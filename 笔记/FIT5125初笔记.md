### 1.Research

`Research`

定义：A systematic process of collecting, analysing, and interpreting information (data) to discover  new facts, procedures, methods and techniques or better understand them

目的：create new knowledge



Observation & Experiment provides ‘facts’ and evaluates theory

Theory provides models and theories of reality



`Research methods `

定义：are the **skills** and practices that create knowledge that inform the day-to-day innovation that happens in companies across the world.

目的：help create new knowledge

本质(如何帮助)：Use different tools for data collection + using different types of research methods. 

A strategy that focuses on researching the problem and developing appropriate solutions.



**Research methods, split into 4 categories** 

- Framing your research (including framing, ethics and literature); 
- Qualitative methods – which are used when asking questions of people directly (such as interviews, focus groups and questionnaires); 
- Quantitative methods – used when you need to analyse and answer questions on numerical data (includes useful statistical approaches, and an understanding of machine learning) 
- how to communicate and protect the new generated knowledge.
