## Week01:Design a Research Question

### 1.Research

`Research`

定义：A systematic process of collecting, analysing, and interpreting information (data) to discover  new facts, procedures, methods and techniques or better understand them

目的：create new knowledge



Observation & Experiment provides ‘facts’ and evaluates theory

Theory provides models and theories of reality



`Research methods `

定义：are the **skills and practices** that create knowledge that inform the day-to-day innovation that happens in companies across the world.

目的：help create new knowledge

本质：

- Use different tools for data collection + using different types of research methods. 

- A strategy that focuses on researching the problem and developing appropriate solutions.



**Research methods/designs, split into 4 categories** 

- Framing your research (including framing, ethics and literature); 
- Qualitative methods – which are used when asking questions of people directly (such as interviews, focus groups and questionnaires); 
- Quantitative methods – used when you need to analyse and answer questions on numerical data (includes useful statistical approaches, and an understanding of machine learning) 
- how to communicate and protect the new generated knowledge.

`Research process in IT`

The **research process** in information technology involves `5` steps: 

- posing a question or problem
- formulating goals and objectives
- Plan and Design research
- implementing and generate research results
- analysing and interpreting the results.





### 2.Research question

Questions such as: 诸如此类的问题：

- “How do you know if changing the UI on your e-commerce site will affect user dwell-time?”,
  “你怎么知道改变电子商务网站的用户界面是否会影响用户停留时间？”，
- “How is your new search algorithm performing compared to competitors or your old version?”,
  “与竞争对手或您的旧版本相比，您的新搜索算法表现如何？”，
- “How reliable is my re-developed image recognition tool for my customers”
  “我重新开发的图像识别工具对我的客户来说有多可靠”
- “What are the core challenges my users are currently facing”
  “我的用户目前面临的核心挑战是什么”
